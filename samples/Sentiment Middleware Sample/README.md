## Sentiment Middleware Sample

This sample shows how to use the Sentiment Analysis Middleware in your bot. In Startup.cs file, you can choose the Middleware to work with either Cognitive Services or ML.NET based Sentiment Analyzer.

Currently, it will only return a score (from 0.1 being negative to 0.9 or 1 being positive).
