# Unofficial MessageBird WhatsApp Adapter for Bot Builder v4 .NET SDK

This project is created by Ahmet Kocadoğan to help Bot Framework community for WhatsApp channel and not related with MessageBird officially.

# Description

This is part of the [Bot Builder Community Extensions](https://github.com/botbuildercommunity) project which contains various pieces of middleware, recognizers and other components for use with the Bot Builder .NET SDK v4.

The MessageBird WhatsApp adapter enables receiving and sending WhatsApp messages. The MessageBird adapter allows you to add an additional endpoint to your bot for receiving WhatsApp messages. The MessageBird endpoint can be used in conjunction with other channels meaning, for example, you can have a bot exposed on out of the box channels such as Facebook and Teams, but also via an MessageBird (as well as side by side with the Google/Twitter adapters also available from the Bot Builder Community Project).

Incoming MessageBird message requests are transformed, by the adapter, into Bot Framework Activites and then when your bot sends outgoing activities, the adapter transforms the outgoing Activity into an MessageBird messages.

The adapter currently supports the following scenarios:

* Send/receive messages with WhatsApp Sandbox
* Send/receive text messages
* Send/receive media messages (document, image, video, audio) - Supported formats for media message types available [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/media/#supported-files)
* Send/receive location messages
* Verification of incoming MessageBird requests (There is one issue for delivery report webhook verification, MessageBird team is investigating.)
* Receive delivery reports
* Full incoming request from MessageBird is added to the incoming activity as ChannelData

### Prerequisites

Create a [MessageBird](https://messagebird.com/en/whatsapp/) account and activate WhatsApp Sandbox.
Get your [SigningKey](https://dashboard.messagebird.com/en/developers/settings)
Get your [AccessKey](https://dashboard.messagebird.com/en/developers/access)

### Set the MessageBird options

At the end of process you will get the following parameters:
* Signing Key - will be used for requests authentication and authorization 
* Access Key - endpoint on which messages will be sent


To authenticate the requests, you will need to configure the Adapter with the Signing Key, Access Key and WhatsApp Sandbox parameter.

You could create in the project an `appsettings.json` file to set the MessageBird options as follows:

```json
{
  "MessageBirdAccessKey": "",
  "MessageBirdSigningKey": "",
  "MessageBirdUseWhatsAppSandbox": true
}
```

### Wiring up the MessageBird adapter in your bot

After you completed the configuration of your MessageBird adapter, you need to wire up the MessageBird adapter into your bot.



#### Create an MessageBird adapter class

Create a new class that inherits from the ***MessageBirdAdapter*** class. This class will act as our adapter for the MessageBird WhatsApp channel. It includes error handling capabilities (much like the ***BotFrameworkAdapterWithErrorHandler*** class already in the sample, used for handling requests from Azure Bot Service).

```csharp
    public class MessageBirdAdapterWithErrorHandler : MessageBirdAdapter
    {
        public MessageBirdAdapterWithErrorHandler(ILogger<MessageBirdAdapter> logger, MessageBirdAdapterOptions adapterOptions)
            : base(adapterOptions, logger)
        {
            OnTurnError = async (turnContext, exception) =>
            {
                // Log any leaked exception from the application.
                logger.LogError($"Exception caught : {exception.Message}");

                // Send a catch-all apology to the user.
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync("Sorry, it looks like something went wrong.");
            };
        }
    }
```

You will also need to add the following using statements.

```cs
  using Bot.Builder.Community.Adapters.MessageBird;
  using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
```

#### Create a new controller for handling MessageBird requests

You now need to create a new controller which will handle requests for incoming WhatsApp messages, delivery and seen reports, on a new endpoint 'api/messagebird' instead of the default 'api/messages' used for requests from Azure Bot Service Channels. By adding an additional endpoint to your bot, you can accept requests from Bot Service channels (or additional adapters), as well as from MessageBird, using the same bot.


```csharp
  [Route("api/messagebird")]
  [ApiController]
  public class MessageBirdController : ControllerBase
  {
      private readonly MessageBirdAdapter Adapter;
      private readonly IBot Bot;

      public MessageBirdController(MessageBirdAdapter adapter, IBot bot)
      {
          Adapter = adapter;
          Bot = bot;
      }

      [HttpPost]
      public async Task PostAsync()
      {
          // Delegate the processing of the HTTP POST to the adapter.
          // The adapter will invoke the bot.
          await Adapter.ProcessAsync(Request, Response, Bot);
      }
  }
```

You will also need to add the following using statements.



#### Inject MessageBird Adapter In Your Bot Startup.cs

Add the following line into the ***ConfigureServices*** method within your Startup.cs file, which will register your MessageBird adapter with two dependencies and make it available for your new controller class. The configuration settings, described in the previous step, will be automatically used by the adapter.

```csharp
  //Add dependencies for MessageBird Adapter
  services.AddSingleton<MessageBirdAdapterOptions>();

  // Add MessageBird Adapter with the error handler
  services.AddSingleton<MessageBirdAdapter, MessageBirdAdapterWithErrorHandler>();

```
